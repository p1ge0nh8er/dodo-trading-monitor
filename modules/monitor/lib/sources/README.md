# Sources

This unit is used to implement sources for trade-monitoring. A few examples could be - plain events from Ethereum, bloXroute, alchemy etc.

The source must implement the interfaces described in [types](./types.ts)

**TODO**: Make the sources interface with the registry(which should store onchain event->real-life event mappings)
